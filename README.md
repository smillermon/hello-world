Learning to use github

Hello fellow githubbers, 
I'm learning how to code and develop webpages. 
I hope this will be a very useful tool for me in the future.
So far, I have had classes using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP,
Java, C#, MySQL, and a little bit of WordPress mostly through
online classes at Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College (WITC). 
I will be graduating this May with an Associate Degree. It's a 
very exciting time!  : )
